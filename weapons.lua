Goals:

do a completely modular system - have a bunch of parts that mesh together, layer together images and just go crazy basically - goal: 100,000 types of weapons

over 400 types of weapons -
each with their base set of things
-accuracy, fire rate, semi-full-single action etc, make every part of the gun modular, make every part of it customizable, aka let's have a scoped chain gun magnum with a silencer and hand grip

Go insane with this

--play different songs based on the country of origin, for example, picking up an ak47 http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100606
